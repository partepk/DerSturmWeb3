## Extracting HTML files

A sitemap of the original Der-Sturm webpage is generated by using any sitemap generator online. The "sitemap.xml" file is then read by the "readXML.py" script to automatically extract every single page in the website. There is no need for you to run this script after you clone, since the repository already comes with all the html files extracted by this script.

## Uploading the software to decentralized network

As public ipfs providers don't allow softwares to be hosted on their community driven networks, the software uses web3.storage as their ipfs provider. Uploading the software to ipfs network can either be done with terminal, or by the web client.
